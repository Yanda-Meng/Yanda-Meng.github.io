About Me
====

+ A final yead PhD student (submission pending) in the department of Eye and Vision Science, University of Liverpool, UK. He is supervised by Prof.[Yalin Zheng](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/life-course-and-medical-sciences/staff/yalin-zheng/) and Prof. [Xiaowei Huang](https://cgi.csc.liv.ac.uk/~xiaowei/).

+ Yanda's current research mainly focuses on the area of Medical Image Analysis, Scene Understanding, Data-Efficient Learning. He has authored many publications at prestigious journals/conferences, such as ICCV, ECCV, BMVC, MICCAI, IEEE-TMI, Diabetologia, etc.. He serves as reviewers for many journal/conferecens succ as CVPR, ECCV, MICCAI, MIDL, IEEE-TMI, IEEE-JBHI, etc..
