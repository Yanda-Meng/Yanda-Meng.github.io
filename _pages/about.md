About Me
====

+ A 3rd yead PhD student in department of Eye  and Vision Science, University of Liverpool, UK.  

+ I am advised by Dr.[Yalin Zheng](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/life-course-and-medical-sciences/staff/yalin-zheng/) and Dr. [Xiaowei Huang](https://cgi.csc.liv.ac.uk/~xiaowei/).

+ My research mainly focuses on the area of medical image analysis and scene understanding, particularly in Geometric Deep Learning (i.e., graph convolution networks), data-efficient learning.
